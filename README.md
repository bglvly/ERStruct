# ERStruct
A MATLAB toolbox for inferring number of sub-populations based on genotype information

## Data files requirements
Data files must be of .mat format. The data matrix inside must with 0,1,2 and NaN (for missing values) only, the rows represent indivials and columns represent markers. If there are more than one data files, the data matrix inside must with the same number of rows. (Try spliting the data files into smaller ones if out of memory error occures)
